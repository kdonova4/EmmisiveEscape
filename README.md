# EmmisiveEscape
-A game I made with Unity during the Summer in My free time

-Just a Project to experiment with Unity building My first real 3d game

-This game is a bit of a remake of One of my 2D games I made for

-The Movement was not done by me as I started this project as something completely different and then transformed into a game concept and it was to much work to change it, It was taken as from a tutorial on youtube to start out with.

-The Map was made by me while using textures online and various free assets from the Unity Store
